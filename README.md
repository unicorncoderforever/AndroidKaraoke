# Android Audio Karaoke Recording SDK 
## A Karaoke Recording SDK (tries to remove the vocals from mp3, mp4 files to an extent and record your voice with the song)
As I love singing, and found these karaoke applications charging bomb for using their songs.It really pushed me to have inhouse application where I can sing unlimited song without paying anyone or watching ads for hours.

### Features
- Suppress the vocal from the streao songs(local mp3, mp4 files)
- Records the song(do put earphones while recording the karaoke song)with the background audio
- Applies Gain filter , However i tried applying one small filter (gain filter)
- Save the recorder song in user preferred location

### Feauture Improvements
- Error codes need to be passed , to be precise about the errors (from decoder , or exporter)
- Vocal suppression may not work for all songs , may in future if I get some ML model which detects the vocals in the songs would be helpful 
- Audio latency is the issue, if someone could help me to fix that would be greateful
- Additional audio filters on the karaoke.

Need more details on the SDK please follow my medium article
